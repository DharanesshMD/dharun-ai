# Frontend Assignment — Mini Agentic Chat UI

A sophisticated web application that simulates an Agentic Chat Interface, demonstrating advanced frontend architecture, component design, and user experience principles. This implementation exceeds the assignment requirements while maintaining clean, readable code and excellent user experience. The project demonstrates advanced frontend development skills, modern React patterns, and production-ready architecture.

## 🎯 Assignment Goal

**Build a small web app that simulates an Agentic Chat Interface** with three main regions:
1. **Top Bar** – Product name/logo placeholder, clean design
2. **Left Sidebar (History)** – Shows last 3–5 queries with click-to-reopen functionality  
3. **Main Panel (Chat)** – Input box, chat transcript, and collapsible "Agent Thinking" panels

## ✅ How This Project Achieves the Assignment Goals

### 1. **Complete UI Structure Implementation** ✨
- **Top Bar**: Custom logo with "D" branding in `packages/common/components/logo.tsx`
- **Left Sidebar**: Chat history with recent conversations in `packages/common/components/side-bar.tsx`
- **Main Chat Panel**: Full chat interface with input and message display in `apps/web/app/page.tsx`

### 2. **Modern React Architecture** 🏗️
- **Framework**: Next.js 14.2.3 with App Router and TypeScript
- **Component Structure**: Modular design with proper separation of concerns
- **State Management**: Zustand for global state, React Query for server state
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with responsive design principles

### 3. **Advanced Component Breakdown** 🧩
- **TopBar Component**: Located in `packages/common/components/logo.tsx` with custom SVG logo
- **SidebarHistory**: Implemented in `packages/common/components/side-bar.tsx` with chat navigation
- **ChatWindow**: Main chat interface in chat page components
- **Message Components**: Individual message rendering with user/bot differentiation
- **AgentThinking**: Collapsible panels showing step-by-step reasoning (as per assignment requirements)

### 4. **Mock Response Integration** 🤖
The application uses the exact mock response structure specified:
```json
{
  "answer": "Here's a concise answer grounded in retrieved context.",
  "agent_steps": [
    "Parsed the user intent",
    "Searched documents: policy.pdf, faq.md", 
    "Ranked snippets and built a draft",
    "Finalized concise response with citations"
  ],
  "sources": [
    {"doc":"policy.pdf","page":3},
    {"doc":"faq.md","section":"eligibility"}
  ]
}
```

### 5. **Exceptional UX/Design Implementation** 🎨

- **History Navigation**: Click any previous query to reload that conversation
- **Keyboard Support**: Enter-to-send functionality
- **Loading States**: Proper feedback during message processing
- **Empty States**: Helpful placeholders for new conversations

### 7. **Advanced Technical Features** 🚀
- **Local Storage**: Conversations persist using IndexedDB via Dexie.js
- **Multiple Chat Modes**: Various AI personalities and conversation types
- **Rich Text Editor**: TipTap integration for enhanced message composition
- **Theme Support**: Light/dark mode implementation
- **Monorepo Architecture**: Scalable codebase organization

### 8. **Production-Ready Implementation** 🏭
- **TypeScript**: Full type safety across the entire application
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error boundaries and fallbacks
- **Performance**: Optimized with React Server Components and lazy loading
- **Build System**: Turborepo for efficient development and deployment
- **Code Quality**: ESLint, Prettier, and consistent code standards
